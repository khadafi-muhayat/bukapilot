What is bukapilot?
------
***Todo: Add some images

[bukapilot](http://github.com/kommuai/bukapilot) is an open source software for advanced driver's assistant system (ADAS). It is a maintained patchset based on [openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) which aims to support all Malaysian vehicles especially for Perodua and Proton by using hardwares specially designed for them, while adding complete right hand drive support on top of the existing capability from openpilot.

bukapilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Lane Keep Assist (LKA), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) for a growing variety of supported [car makes, models and model years](#supported-cars). In addition, while bukapilot is engaged, a camera based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers.

Integration with Stock Features
------
All supported vehicles:
* Stock LKA is replaced by bukapilot LKA, which only functions when bukapilot is engaged by the user.
* Stock LDW is replaced by bukapilot LDW.

Additionally, on specific supported cars (see ACC column in [supported cars](#supported-cars)):
* Stock ACC is replaced by bukapilot ACC.
* bukapilot FCW operates in addition to stock FCW.

bukapilot should preserve all other vehicle's stock features, including, but are not limited to: FCW, Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB), auto high-beam, blind spot warning, and side collision warning.

We have detailed instructions for [how to install the device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup).

Bukapilot patchset modifies the code heavily to integrate with our hardware and backend services, thus we can't make any statement for openpilot supported cars.  Instead, we plan to offer commerical support for the following:

| Make      | Model                         | ADAS     | LKAS                      | Gas                        | Brake         |
| ----------| ------------------------------| ---------| --------------------------| ---------------------------| --------------|
| Perodua   | Axia Advanced 2019            | ASA2.0   | KommuActuator<sup>1</sup> | KommuActuator<sup>1</sup>  | None          |

<sup>1</sup>KommuActuator is a hardware used to provide steering control and stop-and-go capability to some of the bukapilot-supported cars that don't currently support CAN-enabled controls.

KommuAssist Installation Instructions
------
Install bukapilot on a supported device by entering ``https://s4.kommu.ml/upload/bp/installer_openpilot`` during the installer setup.

Follow these [video instructions](https://youtu.be/FktYvHD1PD0) to properly mount the device on the windshield. Note: bukapilot features an automatic pose calibration routine and bukapilot performance should not be affected by small pitch and yaw misalignments caused by imprecise device mounting.

You will be able to engage bukapilot after reviewing the onboarding screens and finishing the calibration procedure.

Limitations of bukapilot LKA and LDW
------

bukapilot LKA and bukapilot LDW do not automatically drive the vehicle or reduce the amount of attention that must be paid to operate your vehicle. The driver must always keep control of the steering wheel and be ready to correct the bukapilot LKA action at all times.

While changing lanes, bukapilot is not capable of looking next to you or checking your blind spot. Only nudge the wheel to initiate a lane change after you have confirmed it's safe to do so.

Many factors can impact the performance of bukapilot LKA and bukapilot LDW, causing them to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:

* Poor visibility (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions that may interfere with sensor operation.
* The road facing camera is obstructed, covered or damaged by mud, ice, snow, etc.
* Obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.
* The device is mounted incorrectly.
* When in sharp curves, like on-off ramps, intersections etc...; bukapilot is designed to be limited in the amount of steering torque it can produce.
* In the presence of restricted lanes or construction zones.
* When driving on highly banked roads or in presence of strong cross-wind.
* Extremely hot or cold temperatures.
* Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).
* Driving on hills, narrow, or winding roads.

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of bukapilot components. It is the driver's responsibility to be in control of the vehicle at all times.

Limitations of bukapilot ACC and FCW
------

bukapilot ACC and bukapilot FCW are not systems that allow careless or inattentive driving. It is still necessary for the driver to pay close attention to the vehicle’s surroundings and to be ready to re-take control of the gas and the brake at all times.

Many factors can impact the performance of bukapilot ACC and bukapilot FCW, causing them to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:

* Poor visibility (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions that may interfere with sensor operation.
* The road facing camera or radar are obstructed, covered, or damaged by mud, ice, snow, etc.
* Obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.
* The device is mounted incorrectly.
* Approaching a toll booth, a bridge or a large metal plate.
* When driving on roads with pedestrians, cyclists, etc...
* In presence of traffic signs or stop lights, which are not detected by bukapilot at this time.
* When the posted speed limit is below the user selected set speed. bukapilot does not detect speed limits at this time.
* In presence of vehicles in the same lane that are not moving.
* When abrupt braking maneuvers are required. bukapilot is designed to be limited in the amount of deceleration and acceleration that it can produce.
* When surrounding vehicles perform close cut-ins from neighbor lanes.
* Driving on hills, narrow, or winding roads.
* Extremely hot or cold temperatures.
* Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.).
* Interference from other equipment that generates radar waves.

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of bukapilot components. It is the driver's responsibility to be in control of the vehicle at all times.

Limitations of bukapilot DM
------

bukapilot DM should not be considered an exact measurement of the alertness of the driver.

Many factors can impact the performance of bukapilot DM, causing it to be unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:

The list above does not represent an exhaustive list of situations that may interfere with proper operation of bukapilot components. A driver should not rely on bukapilot DM to assess their level of attention.

User Data and Kommu Account
------

By default, bukapilot uploads the driving data to our servers. You can also access your data by pairing with the KommuApp ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/comma-connect/id1456551889), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.comma.connect&hl=en_US)). We use your data to train better models and improve bukapilot for everyone.

bukapilot logs the road facing camera, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.
The driver facing camera is logged by default but you can explicitly opt-out in settings. The microphone is not recorded.

By using bukapilot, you agree to [our Privacy Policy](https://kommu.ai/privacy/). You understand that use of this software or its related services will generate certain types of user data, which may be logged and stored at the sole discretion of Kommu. By accepting this agreement, you grant an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide right to Kommu for the use of this data.

Safety and Testing
----
DISCLAIMER: bukapilot is still under development by a limited number of members. Duty of care will be taken to ensure the safety of both the hardware and the software. 

As a patchset of openpilot, bukapilot benefits from the software safety model of openpilot.  Incremental tests are being implemented to ensure the correctness of the patchset on top of the openpilot release.
